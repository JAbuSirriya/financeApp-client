# Budgeting Easy
 
This application helps users organize their finances. After signing in, the user can add a transaction to a specific account with the amount and description—such as “bought t-shirt” or “sold car”. The transaction will then be added to the “List Transactions” page. The user can also see their checking, savings, and cash-on-hand accounts updated. 

Developed the application using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. Data regarding the individual users, and the users’ monetary accounts is stored in a MongoDB database.

Utilized React, HTML5, and CSS for creating the frontend and connecting it to the backend and MongoDB.
